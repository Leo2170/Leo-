<p>
  With week 14 of the NFL being done we saw some interesting things happened this Sunday. Results such as the Vikings losing to the lions and now are 9-2 on the season. It’s been noted by many analysts that their record is quite deceiving, as their defense isn’t all that good. We also had the Dallas Cowboys almost lose to the Houston Texans,  and had to win via a game winning drive. Dak Prescott threw 2 interceptions that game which kept the Texans in the game. We also have the Philadelphia eagles which claimed their playoff spot and move to 12-1 on the season. Tom Brady’s Tampa Bay Buccaneers also got blown out by the San Fransisco 49ers with their thirst string QB. It was a very pleasant weekend of football and we finish it off today with the Arizona Cardinals vs New England Patriots.
