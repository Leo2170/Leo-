<br> As we all know, QATAR's long awaited 2022 World Cup has finally arrived. Currently in semi-finals, we have 4 teams remaining being Argentina, France, Morrocco, and Croatia. The most shocking one of them all are Morocco who defeated Portugal 1-0 on Saturday morning. Croatia also pulled off a major upset against the tournament favorite from the start, Brazil. The semi-finals will take place Tuesday and Wednesday with the matches being Argentina vs Croatia, and France vs Morocco. The current favorite to win it is France, followed by Argentina not by much. Whoever will win will have a unique storyline. France would repeat, Messi would get his first ever World Cup and Argentinaâ€™s first since 1986, Morocco the first African team to ever win it, and Croatia who fell short in 2018 coming back to win it all. Who do you got winning taking it home? Let us know down below.

Today's first semi-final kicked off between Croatia and Argentina. The result ended up being 3-0 in favor of Argentina who were thr far superior team today; they are now looking to Sunday as they have secured their spot in the World Cup Final. The contributors to the goals in the match were Julian Alvarez with a double, and Lionel Messi via a penalty kick. Messi also had an assist, making it a very complete performance from the Argentine superstar. Tomorrow at 1pm CT, we will find out who's going to be facing Messi and co. Tune in on FOX.
